FlowTime – An innovative time and task management software tool: Concept
=========================================================================

Origins
-------

A multitude of tasks in office context often have to be kept in the head, and done, at the same time. Moreover, they are very homogenous not only in regard to substantial aspects. Additionally, some tasks are more urgent than other, there are important and less important ones, rather complex and rather simple to-dos. All this tends to cluster in the head. To retain the overview requires an assistance so that you can put your focus on the substantials alone instead of sharing it with considerations all the time which task you better do right now.

This being not enough, another "URGENT"-flagged mail would pop up in your inbox every now and then, the  phone would ring and someone come in your office asking for a favour you could do on the go. Mind this the status quo, as being as it should be, multitasking ideology everywhere, a work culture spinning around itself. There have been surveys and studies: It takes many minutes to restore concentration nearly to the extent like it was before an interruption and a bit longer each time when repeated.

FlowTime will be an open-source software tool that supports in dealing with this situation. It is intended to sustain your capacity to concentrate and the resilience shield against interrupts. In development, two conflicting challenges have to be brought into agreement: On the one hand simplicity and user-friendliness, flexibility on the other in that the application adapts to the user's working methods.

Basically the program shall:

  * **shorten the time needed to refocus after interruptions.** This is the time it takes until one is as deep, mentally, in one's duty as before.

  * **mediate between the office multitaskism and the human brain.** You can do things *well* only one after the other. Claims of differences in multitasking ability between the sexes have no scientific evidence.

  * **remedy interblends of work and life** by moving the urgency increase of registered tasks calculatorily from the leisure time into the working time. For this to achieve the user is required, exercised, motivated at least, to plan in advance with sufficient precision.

The final and main objective of the FlowTime project is to lead to flow experience in office work by software – hence that name is coined – and to a private life free of business worries. See the tool in the kind of time and task management systems. Other programs of this software category are often too simple or too complex, the medium is represented too rarely. FlowTime is neither a simple todo list applet nor a professional project management application. It is considered appropriate for small and medium projects one can overview without aid as single items, but not together. The focus of development shall not be to have it support integration into existing groupware solutions. Rather the disconnection is regarded as an subversive principle. Where there are no nets, there are no interdependencies, there is freedom and concentrated work possible.

FlowTime is realized – already in essential parts – in the Perl programing language. It is free and open source software used under the terms of the GNU General Public License or, at your ...
