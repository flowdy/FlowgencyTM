Frequently Asked Questions

## What is FlowgencyTM?

FlowgencyTM is one of the overwhelming choice of time & task management systems. It is suitable for office workers with a technical or scientific background who mostly conduct or are involved in projects of varying priority, complexity and time necessary. It can be described in short as a multitasking pace-maker, in that "multitasking" is not so much a credo, but rather something our business "suffers from". But we do not need to, really. Users of FlowgencyTM have recognized that.

The genuine advantage of FlowgencyTM compared to other tools is that it maps time onto your personal time model. It is you who defines when which tasks demand your time. Urgency of hidden, paused tasks does not increase. It has increased accordingly faster in the past active phases and will do in the future ones to exactly the same extent.

## Does it have a REST interface?

It "hasn't" one in terms of a special `/api` extending the normal browser interface, rather its HTTP interface is designed with REST compliance in mind. So, yes. [Learn more about the REST API](rest).
